Cost function measures the performance of a machine learning model for a data set. Cost function quantifies the **error between predicted and expected values and presents that error in the form of a single real number.** Depending on the problem, cost function can be **formed in many different ways.** The purpose of cost function is to be either **minimized or maximized.** For algorithms relying on **gradient descent** to optimize model parameters, every function **has to be differentiable.**
## Types of Cost Function
- [[Mean Squared Error Cost Function (MSE)]] : used in  Linear Regression.
