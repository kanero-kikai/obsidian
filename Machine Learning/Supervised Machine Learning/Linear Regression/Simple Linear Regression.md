Linear Regression with only **one feature**.

Here we have a trained parameters, then we just feed the features to the model and it gives us predictions.
## Hypothesis (The Model)
$$f_{w,b}(x)=wx+b$$
- $f_{w,b}(x)$ : (also $\hat y$) the prediction of the model.
- $w,~b$ : the parameters of the model.
- $x$ : the features.
