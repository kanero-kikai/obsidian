Linear Regression is a type of [[Supervised Machine Learning]] that computes the linear relationship between the **dependent variable** $Y$ and one or more **independent features** $X$ by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Types of Linear Regression
- **[[Simple Linear Regression]] :** The one with only **One Feature**.
- **[[Multiple Linear Regression]] :** The one with **More Than One Feature**.
- **[[Univariate Linear Regression]] :** The one with **One Dependent Variable**.
- **[[Multivariate Regression]] :** The one with **More Than One Dependent Variable**.
