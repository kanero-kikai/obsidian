Supervised Machine Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the data we use at training are **Labeled**. This means we know the inputs and there outputs. We use that data to make a model that can predict the outputs for new inputs it wasn't trained on.
## Keywords
(for example let's use a house price prediction problems)
- **Features** : The input data. *e.g.* the size of the house, number of floors and age.
- **Target** : The output data we want to predict. *e.g.* the price of the house.
- **Parameters** : (also weights/coefficients) Variables that we estimate by training the model.
